Thread: log writer</h1>
<p>This thread is responsible for writing data from the log buffer to disk (to the log files). However, it's not responsible for doing fsync() calls. It copies data to system buffers. It is the log flusher thread, which is responsible for doing fsync().</p>
<p>There are following points that need to be addressed by the log writer thread:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p class="startli">Find out how much data is ready in the log buffer, which is concurrently filled in by multiple user threads.</p>
<p class="startli">In the log recent written buffer, user threads set links for every finished write to the log buffer. Each such link is represented as a number of bytes written, starting from a <em>start_lsn</em>. The link is stored in the slot assigned to the <em>start_lsn</em> of the write.</p>
<p class="startli">The log writer thread tracks links in the recent written buffer, traversing a connected path created by the links. It stops when it encounters a missing outgoing link. In such case the next fragment of the log buffer is still being written (or the maximum assigned lsn was reached).</p>
<p class="startli">It also stops as soon as it has traversed by more than 4kB, in which case it is enough for a next write (unless we decided again to do fsyncs from inside the log writer thread). After traversing links and clearing slots occupied by the links (in the recent written buffer), the log writer thread updates <a class="el" href="PAGE_INNODB_REDO_LOG.html#subsect_redo_log_buf_ready_for_write_lsn">log.buf_ready_for_write_lsn</a>.</p>
<p class="startli"><div class="diagraph">

<div class="caption">
Example of links in</div>
</div>
 the recent written buffer"</p>
<dl class="section note"><dt>Note</dt><dd>The log buffer has no holes up to the <em>log.buf_ready_for_write_lsn</em> (all concurrent writes for smaller lsn have been finished).</dd></dl>
<p>If there were no links to traverse, <em>log.buf_ready_for_write_lsn</em> was not advanced and the log writer thread needs to wait. In such case it first uses spin delay and afterwards switches to wait on the <em>writer_event</em>.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">Prepare log blocks for writing - update their headers and footers.</p>
<p class="startli">The log writer thread detects completed log blocks in the log buffer. Such log blocks will not receive any more writes. Hence their headers and footers could be easily updated (e.g. checksum is calculated).</p>
<p class="startli"><div class="diagraph">
<img src="dia_log_writer_complete_blocks.png" />
<div class="caption">
Complete blocks</div>
</div>
 are detected and written"</p>
<p class="startli">If any complete blocks were detected, they are written directly from the log buffer (after updating headers and footers). Afterwards the log writer thread retries the previous step before making next decisions. For each write consisting of one or more complete blocks, the <em>MONITOR_LOG_FULL_BLOCK_WRITES</em> is incremented by one.</p>
<dl class="section note"><dt>Note</dt><dd>There is a special case - when write-ahead is required, data needs to be copied to the write-ahead buffer and the last incomplete block could also be copied and written. For details read below and check the next point.</dd></dl>
<p>The special case is also for the last, incomplete log block. Note that <a class="el" href="PAGE_INNODB_REDO_LOG.html#subsect_redo_log_buf_ready_for_write_lsn">log.buf_ready_for_write_lsn</a> could be in the middle of such block. In such case, next writes are likely incoming to the log block.</p>
<p class="startli"><div class="diagraph">
<img src="dia_log_writer_incomplete_block.png" />
<div class="caption">
Incomplete</div>
</div>
 block is copied"</p>
<p class="startli">For performance reasons we often need to write the last incomplete block. That's because it turned out, that we should try to reclaim user threads as soon as possible, allowing them to handle next transactions and provide next data.</p>
<p class="startli">In such case:</p><ul>
<li>the last log block is first copied to the dedicated buffer, up to the <a class="el" href="PAGE_INNODB_REDO_LOG.html#subsect_redo_log_buf_ready_for_write_lsn">log.buf_ready_for_write_lsn</a>,</li>
<li>the remaining part of the block in the dedicated buffer is filled in with <em>0x00</em> bytes,</li>
<li>header fields are updated,</li>
<li>checksum is calculated and stored in the block's footer,</li>
<li>the block is written from the dedicated buffer,</li>
<li><p class="startli">the <em>MONITOR_LOG_PARTIAL_BLOCK_WRITES</em> is incremented by one.</p>
<dl class="section note"><dt>Note</dt><dd>The write-ahead buffer is used as the dedicated buffer for writes of the last incomplete block. That's because, whenever we needed a next write-ahead (even for complete blocks), we possibly can also write the last incomplete block during the write-ahead. The monitor counters for full/partial block writes are incremented before the logic related to writing ahead is applied. Hence the counter of partial block writes is not incremented if a full block write was possible (in which case only requirement for write-ahead could be the reason of writing the incomplete block).</dd></dl>
<dl class="section remark"><dt>Remarks</dt><dd>The log writer thread never updates <a class="el" href="PAGE_INNODB_REDO_LOG_FORMAT.html#a_redo_log_block_first_rec_group">first_rec_group</a> field. It has to be set by user threads before the block is allowed to be written. That's because only user threads know where are the boundaries between groups of log records. The user thread which has written data ending at lsn which needs to be pointed as <em>first_rec_group</em>, is the one responsible for setting the field. User thread which has written exactly up to the end of log block, is considered ending at lsn after the header of the next log block. That's because after such write, the log writer is allowed to write the next empty log block (<em>buf_ready_for_write_lsn</em> points then to such lsn). The <em>first_rec_group</em> field is updated before the link is added to the log recent written buffer.</dd></dl>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">Avoid read-on-write issue.</p>
<p class="startli">The log writer thread is also responsible for writing ahead to avoid the read-on-write problem. It tracks up to which point the write ahead has been done. When a write would go further:</p><ul>
<li><p class="startli">If we were trying to write more than size of single write-ahead region, we limit the write to completed write-ahead sized regions, and postpone writing the last fragment for later (retrying with the first step and updating the <em>buf_ready_for_write_lsn</em>).</p>
<dl class="section note"><dt>Note</dt><dd>If we needed to write complete regions of write-ahead bytes, they are ready in the log buffer and could be written directly from there. Such writes would not cause read-on-write problem, because size of the writes is divisible by write-ahead region.</dd></dl>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">Else, we copy data to special write-ahead buffer, from which we could safely write the whole single write-ahead sized region. After copying the data, the write-ahead buffer is completed with <em>0x00</em> bytes.</p>
<dl class="section note"><dt>Note</dt><dd>The write-ahead buffer is also used for copying the last incomplete log block, which was described in the previous point.</dd></dl>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">Update write_lsn.</p>
<p class="startli">After doing single write (single fil_io()), the log writer thread updates <a class="el" href="PAGE_INNODB_REDO_LOG.html#subsect_redo_log_write_lsn">log.write_lsn</a> and fallbacks to its main loop. That's because a lot more data could be prepared in meantime, as the write operation could take significant time.</p>
<p class="startli">That's why the general rule is that after doing fil_io(), we need to update <a class="el" href="PAGE_INNODB_REDO_LOG.html#subsect_redo_log_buf_ready_for_write_lsn">log.buf_ready_for_write_lsn</a> before making next decisions on how much to write within next fil_io() call.</p>

Thread: log flusher</h1>
<p>The log flusher thread is responsible for doing fsync() of the log files.</p>
<p>When the fsync() calls are finished, the log flusher thread updates the <a class="el" href="PAGE_INNODB_REDO_LOG.html#subsect_redo_log_flushed_to_disk_lsn">log.flushed_to_disk_lsn</a> and notifies the <a class="el" href="PAGE_INNODB_REDO_LOG_THREADS.html#sect_redo_log_flush_notifier">log flush_notifier thread</a> using os_event_set() on the <em>flush_notifier_event</em>.</p>
<dl class="section remark"><dt>Remarks</dt><dd>Small optimization has been applied - if there was only a single log block flushed since the previous flush, then the log flusher thread notifies user threads directly (instead of notifying the log flush_notifier thread). Impact of the optimization turned out to be positive for some scenarios and negative for other, so further investigation is required. However, because the change seems to make sense from logical point of view, it has been preserved.</dd></dl>
<p>If the log flusher thread detects that none of the conditions is satisfied, it simply waits and retries the checks. After initial spin delay, it waits on the <em>flusher_event</em>.</p>

Thread: log checkpointer</h1>
<p>The log checkpointer thread is responsible for:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Checking if a checkpoint write is required (to decrease checkpoint age before it gets too big).</li>
<li>Checking if synchronous flush of dirty pages should be forced on page cleaner threads, because of space in redo log or age of the oldest page.</li>
<li>Writing checkpoints (it's the only thread allowed to do it!).</li>
</ol>
<p>This thread has been introduced at the very end. It was not required for the performance, but it makes the design more consistent after we have introduced other log threads. That's because user threads are not doing any writes to the log files themselves then. Previously they were writing checkpoints when needed, which required synchronization between them.</p>
<p>The log checkpointer thread updates log.available_for_checkpoint_lsn, which is calculated as: </p><pre class="fragment">    min(log.buf_dirty_pages_added_up_to_lsn, max(0, oldest_lsn - L))
</pre><p>where:</p><ul>
<li>oldest_lsn = min(oldest modification of the earliest page from each flush list),</li>
<li>L is a number of slots in the log recent closed buffer.</li>
</ul>
<p>The special case is when there is no dirty page in flush lists - then it's basically set to the <em>log.buf_dirty_pages_added_up_to_lsn</em>.</p>
<dl class="section note"><dt>Note</dt><dd>Note that previously, all user threads were trying to calculate this lsn concurrently, causing contention on flush_list mutex, which is required to read the <em>oldest_modification</em> of the earliest added page.
